Alternatively, you can obtain a number of credits from your contacts equal to this amount to spend as you see fit. Obtain Information: Your contacts provide you with information, automatically succeeding on a Gather Information check (And covering the credit cost of the check) provided the DC does not exceed 20. Receive Medical Attention: Your contacts provide you and up to three of your allies with medical attention as dispensed by a skilled physician or healer. The length of the treatment cannot exceed 24 hours, but is otherwise free of charge and completely private. Secure Safe House: One of your contacts provides a safe redoubt for you and up to three of your allies, for a number of days equal to your Jedi Knight Class Level. While in hiding, you have no contact with anyone other than the individual who is hiding you. Once the allotted time is up, you must leave the Safe House or risk discovery. For each day you remain in hiding past this deadline, the Gamemaster should roll 1d20. On a result of 15 or higher, your Safe House is discovered, and your contact's complicity in keeping you hidden is exposed."

You must have a suit of Battle Armor to transform into the Dark Armor (Light Battle Armor becomes Light Dark Armor, Battle Armor becomes Dark Armor, and Heavy Battle Armor becomes Heavy Dark Armor). The transformation process takes 1 day for Light Dark Armor, 2 days for Dark Armor, and 3 days for Heavy Dark Armor.

Creating the Sith Talisman takes a Full-Round Action. While you wear or carry the Sith Talisman on your person, you add 1d6 to your damage with Force Powers. You increase your Dark Side Score by 1 when you first wear or carry a Sith Talisman. You can have only one Sith Talisman active at any given time, and if it is destroyed, you cannot create another one for 24 hours. -Create Sith Weapon: You can alchemically treat a Simple Weapon (Melee) or an Advanced Melee Weapon, turning it into a Sith Weapon. You must spend a Force Point and spend 1 hour imbuing the Weapon with the properties of a Sith Alchemical Weapon (See also: Sith Alchemical Weapon Template). A Lightsaber does not ignore the Sith Weapon's DR, and characters who are proficient in the Weapon's use can treat it as a Lightsaber for the purposes of the Block, Deflect, and Redirect Shot Talents (And any Talents that have these Talents as a prerequisite). Additionally, as a Swift Action, the wielder of a Sith Weapon can spend a Force Point to gain a bonus equal to their Dark Side Score to the damage of their next attack made with the Weapon before the end of the encounter.
